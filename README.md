Some tools I wrote to deal with Rubik's cube challenges. Includes things such as
applying sequences of basic moves, or their inverse, testing whether
sequences are equivalent, converting state to string and back
in various formats (including Kociemba's and that of the rubiks-cube-solver.com site),
and generating or inferring edge flips/permutations and corner twists/permutations.
The last group were especially handy for solving Loo-Key at [AngstromCTF 2020](https://2020.angstromctf.com/).

There is no cube solver code included, for that use Kociemba's
[two-phase solver](https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver).
